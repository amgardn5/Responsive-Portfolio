                <p>Hello, my name is Aaron Gardner and I am aspiring to learn the ways of the code. I recently moved to Arizona from California, which I had been working in sales for the past two years since I graduated from ASU in 2016.</p>
                <p>About a year and a half ago I was so fortunate to meet the woman of my dreams when I was traveling in Australia. We just moved to Arizona together, and she will begin work as a software developer for Intel in Chandler. She is the one who has inspired me to take my career to the next level and learn to code.</p>
                <p>I've always been a very social person; however, I've also always been so interested in technology and learning all the pieces to a product's puzzle so my goal is to combine web development with tech sales. In my freetime I enjoy hiking and socializing with friends, studying stocks, and watching baseball. I am very determined to learn a new skill set and excited to see what this course brings!</p>
